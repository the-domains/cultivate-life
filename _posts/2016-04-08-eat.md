There is nothing more satisfactory than pleasing ones basic human need. Despite the fact that cooking might seem basic it is one of the longest existing and most complex and divers arts practised. Using hours in order to create a wonderful dish or a special texture is as rewarding as it can get. Curing ham or cheese for years, boiling soups for hours or  similar things are done around the globe and proof  that the level of sophistication is very high. But also simple techniques and measures can result in great tasting food.
