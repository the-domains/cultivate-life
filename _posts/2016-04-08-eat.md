  There is nothing more satisfactory than pleasing ones basic human need.
  Despite the fact that cooking might seem basic it is one of the longest
  existing and most complex and divers arts practised. Using hours in order to
  create a wonderful dish or a special texture is as rewarding as it can get.
  Curing ham or cheese for years, boiling soups for hours or similar things are
  done around the globe and proof that the level of sophistication is very high.
  But also simple techniques and measures can result in great tasting food.
